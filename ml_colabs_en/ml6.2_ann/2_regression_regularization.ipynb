    "Well, the picture we get now is totally different! The loss on the validation set is much worse than on the test set and, if you look carefully, you may see that it even starts to increase after a while – even though the loss on the train set still decreases or stays low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we resolve the problem presented in the previous section and prevent the network from overfitting? Well, overfitting often occurs because when the model finds it difficult to decrease the loss in a legitimate way, it will start to cheat by memorize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to prevent that kind of problem, we need to use some regularization methods. These are methods designed to help prevent overfitting. The name \"regularization\" derives from the fact that we want our model to capture the real regularities in the data and not start memorizing data, including the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting More Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting more data is generally the best way to improve generalization – given enough data, a learning method should be better able to tell regularities apart from noise. It also shouldn't be able to memorize all data, so it is forced to learn the regularity itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with getting more data is that it is generally very difficult and expensive. A number of other regularization methods have therefore been developed, with a view of getting as much from the data we already have as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularization in Standard Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In most machine learning methods, regularization is done by reducing the capacity of the model in some way – e.g. by decreasing its size (the degree of a polynomial, the size of a decision tree, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps because the model is no longer able to memorize the training set and actually needs to fit the regularities in the data. In artificial neural networks this can be done by decreasing the numbers and sizes of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to decrease the capacity of a neural model is to use a technique known as early stopping. As we saw earlier, one thing that typically happens in the course of training is that even though the loss on the training set keeps decreasing, the loss on the validation set (if used) stops decreasing or even starts growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind early stopping is to simply stop training at that point and restore weights to the point where the validation loss was actually at its minimum. The further advantage of this approach is that it saves some computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularization in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of deep learning is a bit of an exception, because regularization is typically not done by restricting the size of the model. Rather, deep learning practicioners make use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Special layers;\n",
    "* Clever architectures that inject better inductive preferences to the model (i.e. bias it towards the kind of solution that is likely to generalize well);\n",
    "* Data augmentation (e.g. generating new random variants of existing samples);\n",
    "* Transfer learning (i.e. pretraining on a larger dataset);\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "#### What We Are Going to Use In This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular notebook, we are going to keepthings simple. We are only going to use two simple regularization methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early stopping** ;\n",
    "* **Dropout** ;\n",
    "Plus, since the neural network we are using here is a **shallow**  one and the dataset is tiny, making the **neural net smaller**  may actually also be a good way to regularize – even though you typically wouldn't do that in a deep network trained on millions of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note again that throughout the entire process of developing our model, **we are using the training set and the validation set** , but **not**  the testing set. We are reserving the testing set so that we can evaluate the very final version of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with early stopping then. Since the losses can be a bit noisy, early stopping usually has a \"patience\" hyperparameter – this specifies how many steps to wait once the loss has stopped decreasing before the training is actually stopped.\n",

Dropout tends to make the network more robust, improving generalization.\n",
