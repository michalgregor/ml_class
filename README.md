# Educational Material, Machine Learning

This repository holds and links to educational material related to machine learning; most of it is from my machine learning class at the University of Žilina. Some material is from other classes, where I participated.

## Data Analysis

Note: This only covers the part of the course that I taught, which was machine-learning-oriented – not the part on probability and statistics.

### PowerPoint Slides

The PowerPoint slides are hosted in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SxWLaLc8AXglUqL9neI88jqFN7DruiKD?usp=sharing). Again, the slides are in English with Slovak translations provided in the slide notes. The following topics are covered:

## Colab Notebooks' Sources + Solutions (For Teachers)

Colab notebooks' sources are hosted jointly in a single repository, which is only accessible upon request to teachers, because it contains solutions. Most Colab notebooks use cell tagging that allows multiple different versions to be exported automatically: this includes exporting student and teacher versions as well as English and Slovak versions. The tagging system allows efficient joint maintenance of all versions in the same file.

You can request access through [THIS FORM](https://forms.gle/XGHsEyeXcq4VxQvb7). The code is shared under a permissive license, but with the request not to share the teacher versions publicly.
