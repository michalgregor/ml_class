The response variable is the age-standardized suicide rate (the number of suicides per 100 000 population; age-standardization is to account for the different age structures of different countries, since suicide rates vary a lot with age).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main predictor that we want to draw inferences about is countries' LGBTQ acceptance level (on scale from 1 to 10, collected using a survey; the dataset column is called `LGBTI_inclusiveness`). In order to properly judge whether the predictor is a protective factor against suicide, we need to include a number of other predictors that are known to influence the suicide rate as covariates, because some of them might be confounding variables.\n",

    "If you decide to go with the unstandardized version, your model is going to be a bit more interpretable, since all the data will be in the original units. If you get a coefficient of, let's say -0.5 for religiosity, you will know that you would get a 0.5 decrease in the suicide rate for a unit increase in religiosity. With standardized data, the coefficients will have the same interpretation, but both the predictor and the response will be in units, which you do not understand, so it will be more difficult to make judgements about the size of the effect.\n",

    "#### Standardized Coefficients\n",

    "The advantage of standardized coefficients, on the other hand, is that you can make comparisons among coefficients of different predictors much more easily.

There are several reasons for that: the most trivial problem is that we did not take the age standardization into account, but there is a number of much more serious issues. These relationships are not perfectly linear â€“ e.g. they are bound to saturate at some point (otherwise for some countries with particularly low values of `LGBTI_inclusiveness`, increasing it all the way to 10 might work out to having a negative number of suicides, which clearly doesn't make sense). Also, the relationship expressed by the coefficient holds on average, but that does not mean that is is going to describe the reality of every country equally well.\n",

Naturally, if we had the perfect model, we could just plug in the values for all the predictors and compute exactly how many lives would be saved by adjusting any of the predictors.

We also get a p-value for the model as a whole: this is given in the upper part of the table under `Prob (F-statistic)`. This is the p-value for the null hypothesis that all the coefficients are zero. If it is below the significance level, then we can consider the model as such to be statistically significant (even though some of the coefficients might not be).\n",

    "The summary contains a lot of other stats such as the AIC and BIC, R-squared and adjusted R-squared, etc. These speak to the goodness of the fit and so to the quality and predictive power of the model. These are going to be very useful to us in this next section. You may have noted that so far we have been working with the full model and we have done no model selection at all. Naturally, this full model might not be the best choice. Introducing a large number of predictors increases the number of parameters and so also the complexity of the model. This, in turn, can have a negative effect on how well the model generalizes â€“ especially if a large portion of the predictors are actually not that useful.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **The all-combinations approach:**  train a model for each possible combination and pick the model that is the best in terms of some measure, e.g. the BIC. The problem is that this approach can be very computationally expensive, especially if the number of predictors is large â€“ the number of possible models is $2^p$, where $p$ is the number of predictors.\n",
    "* **Forward selection:**  start from a model with just the constant and keep adding variables one by one until some rule is satisfied. The variables are picked according to some criterion, e.g. by picking the variable that is going to reduce the residual sum of squares the most, etc.\n",
    "* **Backward selection:**  start from the full model and keep removing variables one by one until some rule is satisfied. The variables are again picked according to some criterion, e.g. by picking the variable with the largest p-value, etc. The terminating rule can be e.g. that all remaining p-values are below some threshold.\n",
    "#### Variable Selection Methods in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Univariate feature selection methods:**  these methods are based on certain univariate statistical tests (e.g. dropping features with very low variance, etc.). They can usually be applied before a model is even trained, but generally speaking, they are not very powerful. Examples include:* `SelectKBest`: selects the k best features according to some scoring function (e.g. the chi-squared test between the predictor and the class for classification, the ANOVA F-value for regression, etc.);\n",
    "* `SelectPercentile`: selects the top percentile of features according to some scoring function;\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequential feature selection:**  essentially an equivalent of the forward selection method described above; implemented using the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class.\n",
    "* **Recursive feature elimination:**  essentially an equivalent of the backward selection method described above; implemented using the `RFE` class or the `RFECV` class (which also performs cross-validation to find the optimal number of features).\n",
    "* **Model-based feature selection:**  these methods are based on some machine learning model that is used to evaluate the importance of each feature (e.g. a decision tree or a random forest); implemented using the `SelectFromModel` class.\n",
    "* **Custom feature selection:**  We can also select variables e.g. by manually writing a loop over all possible models, selecting the one with the best BIC, etc.\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "These methods available in Scikit-Learn are not super convenient for our use case because they are designed for Scikit-Learn models, while we are using linear regression as implemented in `statsmodels` â€“ because that also computes stats such as BIC and the p-values, which we are going to use when making our selection.\n",

    "* While the relationship between LGBTI acceptance and a lower number of suicides is clear, it is not clear whether the perceived effect can in its entirety be attributed to the LGBTI population â€“ given that societies with accepting attitudes towards LGBTI people are usually also more accepting to other minorities, part of the effect might be explained by lowering the number of suicides in other vulnerable groups as well.\n",
